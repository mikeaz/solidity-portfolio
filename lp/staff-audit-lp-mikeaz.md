# General Comments

Mike, outstanding project! You were able to address all the issues from the original project. Great work.
You write high quality code. Good job with adding code coverage in your tests for your changes.  Thanks for your explanation of the behavior of the transfer tax that you added to the README.  Before reading your note, I noticed that there were no changes to the swap code regarding the transfer.  And after re-examining the code, I concluded that there was no issue. Then I noticed your writeup and it was spot on!  

AWESOME!
